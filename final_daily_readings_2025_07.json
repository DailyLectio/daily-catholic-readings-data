    "exegesis": "The hospitality at Mamre prefigures the Eucharist: Abraham prepares bread, meat, milk and curds for the divine visitors, an Old Testament icon of Trinitarian self-gift and of the Sacrament by which God feeds His people.  Psalm 15 lists the inner dispositions\u2014truthful speech, justice, reverence\u2014that make a soul a worthy host for God's presence.  Paul, writing from prison, proclaims that \"Christ in you\" is the unveiled mystery first promised to Abraham's offspring and now offered to the Gentiles; suffering becomes participation in Christ's redemptive afflictions.  Luke situates Martha and Mary immediately after the Good Samaritan: service and contemplation are not rivals but two expressions of love, yet Jesus insists that receptivity to His Word must ground all action.  The following Sunday (Gn 18:20-32) will revisit Abraham, showing that true hospitality blossoms into intercessory courage for the world.",

The canticle celebrates God as warrior, foreshadowing Christ who conquers through the Cross.  Jesus refuses spectacle: the \"sign of Jonah\" points to His three-day entombment and rising, a victory greater than the parting sea.  Lawrence of Brindisi (1559-1619) debated Protestants in fluent Hebrew and preached crusades against Ottoman forces, relying on prayer as Israel trusted the LORD at the shore.
